# B.Tech CSE AI and DS (3rd Semester) - Machine Learning Assignment

## Assignment Overview

This repository contains the solutions for the Machine Learning assignment for the B.Tech CSE AI and DS program (3rd Semester). The tasks involve dataset exploration, data splitting, and implementing a simple linear regression model. Below is a brief overview of the tasks and the results.

### Task 1: Dataset Exploration

- **Dataset:** The Iris dataset was used for this task.
- **Objective:** Explore the dataset by displaying the first five rows, the dataset's shape, and summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values) for each feature.
- **Results:** The dataset contains 150 samples with 4 features. Summary statistics include mean, standard deviation, and min/max values for each feature.

### Task 2: Data Splitting

- **Objective:** Split the Iris dataset into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split.
- **Results:** The dataset was split into 120 samples for training and 30 samples for testing.

### Task 3: Linear Regression

- **Objective:** Fit a linear regression model to predict `Salary` based on `YearsExperience` using a custom dataset.
- **Results:** The Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the model on the test set was calculated to evaluate its performance.

## Files Included

- `Download.py` - Contains code for exploriaset.
- `Dowmload2.py` - Contains code for splitting the Iris dataset.
- `Dpwnload3.py` - Contains code for fitting and evaluating the linear regression model.
